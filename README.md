# Horloge viewer
- `horloge.json` holds the collection's data
- `template.html` is used as the viewer layout
- `generate.py` is the script that builds the necessary folders with all the `html` and `json` files

To generate the HTML locally:
`python3 generate.py`

You can then start a local server with python
`python3 -m http.server`
